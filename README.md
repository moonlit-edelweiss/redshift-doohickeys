## BULLET_HELL_TEST

A 2D bullet hell microgame where you dodge projectiles that enemies send flying toward you. Beware; some input lag. Also includes a score counter that times how long you've lived.
Has a tendency to break and not start properly - I haven't been able to diagnose this, so just try to start it again when that happens.
